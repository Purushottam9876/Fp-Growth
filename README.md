# Fp-Growth
FP-Growth Algorithm is used to generate frequent itemsets from a transactional dataset. It's faster than Apriori. It scans tha whole dataset only twice while Apriori scans the dataset repeatedly to compute support counts of itemsets. This calculates al frequent itemsets in less cost than Apriori.
